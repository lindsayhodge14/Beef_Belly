Plotly Practice

## Overview
This project analyzes and displays the results/observations derived from a dataset of particpants. Using plotly, d3, json, andjavascript the dashboard displayed below was created. All of the code used to construct the dashboard can be found in this repo. Users of the dashboard will see a brief description and three supplemental data visualizations. If a user desires to narrow their search to a particular participant/UTO ID, they may do so in the dashboard.
